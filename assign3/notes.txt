Assignment 3 "tic-tac-toe" Documentation

To begin the creation of this game using react, I had to first set up a local
development environment for the react app. Make sure Node.js is installed. 
Use "npx create-react-app my-app" to create the app and then delete all the 
existing source files. Now create two source files index.css and index.js in 
src/ with the provided tutorial code. Also import React and ReactDom in the 
javascript file as well as import the css file. Then, in the tutorial file, 
use "npm start" to view the app locally. 

We are first given the barebones of the game. When the react components are
rendered, we have a 3x3 gridbox with currently no features. The javascript 
code is the main focus since the css is already done for us. Using react, 
we have three react components in the form of classes:
1. Square
2. Board
3. Game
At this point, the Square class simply renders a button tag which uses a css 
selector to take the form of a box. 
The Board class has a method called renderSquare that takes in an argument 
and returns a Square component. In the render method, Board displays the 
status of whose turn it is as well as renders 9 Square components by calling 
renderSquare 9 times in a 3x3 grid format. 
The Game class renders a Board component. 

Now, we will add react features to make the game interactable.
