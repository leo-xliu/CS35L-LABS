Lab B Question 2
The difference between cloning the repository from Github and the one stored on the Seasnet machine is one that pertains to remote and local cloning. When cloning from Github directly, we are cloning the repository remotely; when cloning on the Seasnet machine from a local repository, it is a local clone. The difference we see when using ‘git branch -a’ is that the Github clone has an additional branch ‘remotes/origin/main’ which the local clone does not have. Another difference would be that local clones can have .git files which contain the commit history to point to the original repository’s .git files which makes cloning much faster and takes less space. Meanwhile, this is not possible cloning remotely.
