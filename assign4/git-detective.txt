Starting with the release Notes of the git version that is listed in the problem, I found the commit by locating it on Github’s webpage which is af6d1d602a (abbreviated) and with that I can then run ‘git log af6d1d602a >log.txt’ This provides us with a starting point for where to look since no commits after this would be necessary. I also had the output to be redirected into a text file so I can use emacs to easily navigate. Once on log.txt, I used emac’s i-search command to look for keywords such as ‘git diff’ and with that I was able to find the commit 872c9e67ec which upon further inspection of the commit message and commit type we find that it is a merge commit dealing with this issue. Since ‘git log’ tells us the branches they merged, I followed both branches to see which one contained the changes for this issue and found the commit 8174627b3d. Then I used ‘git diff 8174627b3d^!’ to see the changes made in this commit. This commit included code changes that resolved the issue and is detailed in the commit message how it fixes the issue. Afterwards, I decided to use ‘git log 8174627b3d’ to check any other previous commits that may have also helped resolve the issue but found none that matched. Thus, I concluded only the commit 8174627b3d contained the code changes that fixed the issue. 

The actual code changes that fixed the issue are contained in the patch-file included but, briefly, is contained in the source file ‘diff-lib.c’ where an ‘if statement’ was added and also in the shell script ‘t/t4045-diff-relative.sh’ that included many tests to check the ‘--relative’ option for ‘git diff’.

Since SHA1 commit ID 8174627b3d is the only one with the actual code changes that fixed the issue, I ran the command ‘git format-patch -1 8174627b3d ‘ to generate a patch file for this commit.
